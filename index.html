      <!-- Paragraph -->
      <p>My name is Justin 석원 Choi, I'm Korean American, I'm 29 years young, I grew up in the bay area, and I am very excited to begin honing my craft as a SWE as a student through UC Berkeley's Extension Coding Program. I love music, art and the outdoors. I also love fruit, fresh produce, and while this may seem a bit off-topic, I am enamored with both the plausibility and practicality of sustainable farming as a competitive business practice. What does this have anything to do with coding and tech? Similar to how sustainable farming practices can be used to diversify and enhance the fruits and vegetables that we see on our grocery store shelves so that we not only have more options, but also so that they taste more sweet and more flavorful, while also preventing food famines and drastically improving working conditions for farmers all around the world, I really do believe that as we improve the way we develop and use software, that we can strengthen our tech economy so that it is not only more stable, but also more diverse, inclusive and sustainable as well. I'm firmly convinced that the notion of competition and sustainability being incompatible is nothng more than a myth. Galileo was imprisoned, tortured and was put on house arrest where he was emotinally starved until he passed away for suggesting that the Earth revolved around the Sun. It's no big surprise that older generations are skeptical of and intimidated by our vision of the future. But to them I say: We care about our children just as much as you do. In fact, we objectively have a lot more at stake. The problems we are dealing with are undeniably real and imporant. Let's work together on this. And let's do this right. We only have one inhabitable planet in our solar system. Let's let go of our delusional ideas of developing a settlement on a planet with no ozone, and focus more on loving and appreciating the beautiful home that we already have. Let's focus more on teaching our youth to treat mother nature with the respect that she deserves. Let's focus more on showing them how to engage in healthy competition with one another and live harmoniously with one another. Let's focus less on our fear of the unknown, and focus more on leading by example.</p>
